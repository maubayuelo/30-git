Was a great class, I started and took some other classes and came back to it. Angela covered many of the fundamentals to get you started in Web Development. The Web 3 stuff was super interesting but a large learning curve, but worth it if you looking to expand your mind. Futhermore learning the Web 3 makes you up your skills because the format of the file structure has changed with updates and in order to get it to work you have to figure it out yourself; which is one Angela's core principles for leveling up.
